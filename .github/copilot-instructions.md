- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. Created .github directory and copilot-instructions.md file.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements. Project is a C# library for identity servers, supporting OpenID, OAuth 2.0, and OAuth 2.1 flows.

- [x] Scaffold the Project
	Created .NET solution with multiple class library projects: OroIdentityServers (main), OroIdentityServers.Core, OroIdentityServers.OAuth, OroIdentityServers.OpenId.

- [x] Customize the Project
	Added basic classes: Client in Core, TokenRequest in OAuth, OpenIdConnectRequest in OpenId, and IdentityServer in main project.

- [x] Install Required Extensions
	No extensions needed.

- [x] Compile the Project
	Project compiles without errors.

- [x] Create and Run Task
	No task needed for library project.

- [x] Launch the Project
	Library project cannot be launched directly.

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	README.md created and copilot-instructions.md cleaned.

## Fase 4: Testing and Calidad
- [x] Fix compilation errors in OroIdentityServerExample
	Fixed missing packages, usings, and interface implementation. Project now compiles successfully.
	Fixed middleware dependency injection issues by resolving scoped services within request scopes.
	Application now runs successfully with SQLite database, automatic migrations, and seeding.
	OpenID Connect discovery endpoint is working correctly.

- [ ] Create PostgreSQL example
	Pending implementation.

- [ ] Create MySQL example  
	Pending implementation.

- [ ] Add integration tests
	Pending implementation.

- [x] Update documentation with working examples
	README.md updated in English with current implementation details, working examples, and database provider guides.

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.

EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
